DIFFERENCES Controller vs Service

Responsibilities:
-The requestLoan method in the LoanController is primarily responsible for handling HTTP requests and interacting with
clients, while the requestLoan method in the LoanService focuses on implementing the core business logic related to loan requests.

Abstraction Level:
-The requestLoan method in the LoanController operates at a higher level of abstraction, dealing with HTTP-specific
concerns and delegating business logic to the service layer.
-The requestLoan method in the LoanService operates at a lower level of abstraction, implementing the detailed logic
required to process loan requests, validate inputs, and interact with the database.

Coupling and Cohesion:
-The LoanController and LoanService are loosely coupled, with the controller depending on the service to perform business
 logic. This separation of concerns improves maintainability and allows for easier unit testing.
-The LoanService exhibits high cohesion, as it encapsulates related operations related to loan processing, while the
controller focuses on handling HTTP requests and responses.

*** In summary, while both methods share a common name and purpose, they operate at different layers of the application and
serve distinct roles in implementing the lending functionality. The separation of concerns between the controller and
service layers helps to maintain a clear and modular architecture, facilitating code reuse, testing, and maintainability.
